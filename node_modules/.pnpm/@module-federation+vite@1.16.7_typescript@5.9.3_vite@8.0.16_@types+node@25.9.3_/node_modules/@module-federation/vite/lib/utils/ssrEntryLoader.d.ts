//#region src/utils/ssrEntryLoader.d.ts
/**
 * MF runtime plugin that intercepts the `loadEntry` lifecycle hook on the
 * server and loads the SSR-compatible remote entry instead of the browser one.
 *
 * This completely replaces the need for any `@module-federation/sdk` patches.
 * The `loadEntry` hook is emitted by `runtime-core` before it falls through to
 * `loadScriptNode` — if the hook returns a value, the runtime uses it directly.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *  - In Node (typeof window === 'undefined'), fetch the remote's mf-manifest.json
 *    to discover the ssrRemoteEntry URL and its type.
 *  - ESM entry: use a dynamic `import()` — the SSR entry has no browser
 *    globals and all shared packages are external.
 *  - Dev mode (Vite 8+ only): use `ModuleRunner` with an HTTP transport backed
 *    by the remote's `/__mf_runner__` endpoint. This fetches fully-transformed
 *    module source through Vite's plugin pipeline, avoiding serialisation which
 *    cannot faithfully represent React components or closures.
 *
 *    Dev mode on Vite < 8 is NOT supported — `ModuleRunner` and
 *    `FetchableDevEnvironment` are Vite 8+ APIs. If you need dev-mode SSR on
 *    an older Vite version, implement an alternative loader in `loadSSRRemoteEntry`
 *    for the `isDevSsrEntry` branch and expose a corresponding server endpoint
 *    from `pluginSSRRemoteEntry.configureServer`.
 *
 * Exported as a plain factory function so it can be serialised into the
 * generated runtimePlugins list in virtualRemotes.ts.
